# MVP - Puc Rio - Front-End Advanced

This is the second MVP of the Full Stack Development Postgraduate Program at PUCRS University, Rio de Janeiro.

The goal of this app/pwa is to allow the user to organize their medical appointments, enabling them to register, update, and view appointments in a list or calendar format.

Additionally, the user will be able to install the app and run it offline, because this is a PWA. All interactions will be saved in the local storage whenever there is no internet connection or when the server is unavailable. In a future version, it will be possible to synchronize the offline content with the online content

To install, click on the button located in the footer, 'Install'.

## Commands
- npm install
- npm run dev (will build local and serve localhost)
- npm run pwa (will build for pwa and serve localhost)

## APP features

- create appointment (local storage)
- list in calendar (local storage)
- normal list (local storage)

- change theme color (local storage)
- change theme between light and dark mode. 
- install app (pwa)
