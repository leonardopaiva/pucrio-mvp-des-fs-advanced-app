# MVP - Puc Rio - Front-End Advanced

This is the second MVP of the Full Stack Development Postgraduate Program at PUC Rio University, Rio de Janeiro.

The goal of this app/pwa is to allow the user to organize their medical appointments, enabling them to register, update, and view appointments in a list or calendar format.

Additionally, the user will be able to install the app and run it offline, as this is a Progressive Web App (PWA). All interactions will be saved in the local storage whenever there is no internet connection or when the server is unavailable. In a future version, it will be possible to synchronize the offline content with the online content

To install the app, click on the 'Install' button located in the footer.

## Commands
- npm install
- npm run dev (builds and serves the app locally)"
- npm run pwa (builds for pwa and serve localhost)
- npm run preview (serve pwa for localhost)

## APP features

- Create appointment (local storage)
- List in calendar (local storage)
- Normal list (local storage)
- Delete appointment (local storage)
- Change theme color (local storage)
- Change theme between light and dark mode. 
- Install App (PWA)

- Increase font size in the app (accessibility feature).
- Fix click delay on mobile devices with a CSS rule (no need for FastClickJS or similar js):

}

## TODO:

- Create back-end to save data online
- Sync between online and offline data.
