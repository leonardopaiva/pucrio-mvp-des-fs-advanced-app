# MVP3 - Puc Rio - Full Stack Development Advanced

# Overview

This is the third MVP of the Full Stack Development Postgraduate Program at PUC Rio University, Rio de Janeiro.

The goal of this app/PWA is to allow the user to organize their medical appointments, enabling them to register, update, and view appointments in a list, calendar, or map format.

Additionally, the user will be able to install the app and run it offline, as this is a Progressive Web App (PWA). All interactions will be saved in local storage whenever there is no internet connection or when the server is unavailable. Whenever the user wishes, they can synchronize their data with the cloud.

To install the app, when running the app, click on the 'Install' button located in the footer; this will create a shortcut for the app on your mobile or desktop.

The idea for this app is that it operates entirely offlineâ€” all authenticated operations work by saving data in local storage, without making the user wait for an API request. Afterwards, the user can synchronize their data with the API.

## How to Run the MVP with all micro services
 
This project also comes with a Dockerfile, which provides an additional option for starting up. To better understand how to use it, please refer to the docker-compose.yml in the gateway api repository of this MVP.  
 
For the entire MVP to work, the microservices must be executed using a docker-compose.yml in the gateway api repository.

## Important Note

Before running this app with Docker, you need to enter the app folder and run the commands:
- npm install
- npm run pwa

This will build the app by creating the "dist" folder, which is necessary for the docker-compose.yml or Dockerfile to work.

## Local and Env Variables

- rename .env.local.demo to .env.local and set the VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY value to make the Google Maps Api work.
- set the VITE_API_URL value for .env.production when runing the app with docker
- set the VITE_API_URL value for .env.development when runing the app locally with 'npm run dev'

## Commands
- npm install
- npm run dev (builds and serves the app locally)"
- npm run pwa (builds for pwa and serve localhost)
- npm run preview (serve pwa for localhost)
